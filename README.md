# Ultrasonic Perception Visualization for Mobile Robots

This repository demonstrates a **clear and interpretable ultrasonic perception layer** for a mobile robot.  
It visualizes how **24 ultrasonic sensors** perceive obstacles around the robot and how these measurements are transformed into a **top-down world view with robot motion and heading**.

The goal of this project is **perception understanding and debugging**.

## 📌 What This Project Shows

This project focuses on **how raw ultrasonic sensor data becomes spatial awareness**.

Specifically, it demonstrates:

- Real-time visualization of **24 ultrasonic sensors** arranged around a robot
- Conversion of sensor readings from **polar space → world coordinates**
- Obstacle detection based on a configurable distance threshold
- Robot **trajectory, heading, and motion context**
- Frame-by-frame animation to observe perception over time

This is an essential **first layer** of a Physical AI / Robotics Perception Stack.

## 🧠 Why Ultrasonic Sensors?

Ultrasonic sensors are:

- Low-cost
- Short-range
- Widely used for **collision avoidance and safety**

They are **not high-resolution like LiDAR**, and therefore should **not** look like dense point clouds.

## 📊 Visualization Overview

### 1️⃣ Polar Sensor View (Left)

- Each spike corresponds to one ultrasonic sensor (US1–US24)
- Angles match physical sensor placement
- Distance indicates obstacle proximity
- Red highlights show **near obstacles**

---

### 2️⃣ Top-Down World View (Right)

- Robot position and heading arrow
- Past trajectory (path history)
- Ultrasonic points projected into global coordinates
- Highlighted obstacles within detection range
- Circular detection boundary for safety margin

## 🖼️ Example Result

Below is an example frame from the animation generated by this code:

- **Left:** Polar ultrasonic perception
- **Right:** Top-down spatial map with robot heading and obstacles

> 📌 *Note:* Visualizations are best viewed by **running the code locally** to see the full animation and interaction.

## 📁 Dataset Format

The input dataset is a CSV file with:

- **24 ultrasonic sensor readings per frame**
- A **movement class label** per frame

Example columns:
US1, US2, ..., US24, Class

Example movement classes:
- `Move-Forward`
- `Slight-Left-Turn`
- `Slight-Right-Turn`
- `Sharp-Right-Turn`

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data loading and cleaning
- **NumPy** – geometry and math
- **Matplotlib** – polar plots, animations, and maps

All libraries are standard and lightweight.
